Some of its strengths are that it's easy to conceptualize the data with it, it allows simple decision rules in each node, and it is easy to explain the model to decision makers. Some weaknesses are that it is prone to overfitting, grows exponentially in size with each level of the tree, can be sensitive to small changes in data, and it can have problems with out-of-sample predictions.\n",

Some weaknesses are that the cubic training time makes this not work well with large datasets, it doesn't work well with very noisy data, doesn't inherently provide probability estimates.\n",

It is an instance based model, that stores instances of the data and does not try to make a generalized model. Some of its strengths are its training run time, it's robust to noisy training data, and is effective with large data sets. Some weakness are that it has a high computation cost since it doesn't form a predictive model with the data initially, and the K value and distance formula can make a big difference in its predictive ability.\n",

    "Based on my experiments I chose the support vector machine as the best model. This model had the higher F<sub>1</sub> score for all subsets of data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "F<sub>1</sub> score is a measurement of a system's precision and recall ability. The F<sub>1</sub> score ranges from 0 - 1 where 1 is the best and perfectly predicts the data. Precision is a measure of how often the model predicts a label correctly compared with the total number of times it predicted that label. For instance if this model correctly identified 8 students that needed intervention and predicted 2 other students that it thought needed intervention but really didn't, then it would have a precision of .8 . Recall is the amount of times a model predicts a label correctly compared with the total number actual times that label was true. For instance if this model correctly identified 8 students that needed intervention and there were 8 other students that needed intervention that it predicted didn't need intervention, then it would have a recall of .5 .  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms for our use, precision can be thought of as the ratio of students that we helped to the total students that we helped. Recall can be thought of as the ratio of students that we helped to the total students that needed help. If I had to choose which is more important out of the two, I would prefer a higher recall. This is because we can help more of those students that need help. To achieve a perfect recall we could intervene for each student, but this method does not seem cost effective.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides just looking at F<sub>1</sub> score, other factors to consider are the amount of data, performance, and resource costs the different models will take. All 3 of these models were appropriate based on the data, cost, and performance so the leading factor was just the best F<sub>1</sub> score. The training and prediction times for all 3 models were negligible.\n",

    "To understand SVM let's pretend you are a parent with twins who are about to go to separate college. They share a room and have boxed up everything that they will bring with them. They have asked you to pack those boxes into their respective vehicles and you kindly agreed. As you enter the room you find 40 boxes scattered about. 30 of these boxes have the name of either one of your twins on them, but the remaining 10 do not. SVM treats these 30 boxes as the training data and it will find a way to divide the room so that there exists the most distance between this line and either twin's side of boxes. Since you are a smart person, you notice this division too and you imagine this line in your head. Now these 10 unlabeled boxes are like the testing data from our model. Since you can see what side of the room they are on relative to that division you made earlier, you can predict which twin it belongs to. To see how well our model works, you can open up these boxes and inspect the contents to see how well it did.  \n",
